Mechanism: COVID-19-induced inflammation promotes MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies, leading to IgG production and Encephalomyelitis, Acute Disseminated. (Roughly correct (MOG) side has not that strong support)
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IgG → Immune System Disease

Mechanism: COVID-19-induced inflammation raises IgG levels, leading to immune system diseases and possibly neurodegeneration. (Roughly correct (IgG) side has not that strong support)
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IgG → Immune System Disease → Myelitis → Lymphopenia → MOG → Optic Neuritis

Mechanism: COVID-19-driven inflammation increases IgG, causing immune system diseases, myelitis, lymphopenia, and optic neuritis. (Roughly correct (IgG) side has not that strong support)
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IFNG → IL1B → Taupaties
Source: Sherpa
Mechanism: Inflammation increases IFN-γ and IL-18BP, leading to CXCR4 expression and immune responses.
This come from the evidence, evidence: Tau aggregates, have in turn been shown to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to further production of IL-1β by microglia and aggravation of neuroinflammation [109]. The triple extracted by Sherpa says: IL1B increases taupathies, which is not 100 percent correct but the association is stll meaningful. 
Path:SARS-CoV-2 → Myelitis → Peripheral Nervous System Diseases
Source: Sherpa
Mechanism: COVID-19-induced inflammation causes multiple myelitis, which progresses to myelitis and optic neuritis.
Path:SARS-CoV-2 → IL6→ depression→ TNF→ neurotransmitters→ Encephalitis
Source: Sherpa
Mechanism: SARS-CoV-2 triggers an inflammatory response through IL-6 and TNF, leading to neurotransmitter imbalances and depression. This neuroinflammation can escalate to encephalitis, causing acute brain inflammation.
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IL10 → TREM2→ Hippocampus
Source: SCAI-DMaps
Mechanism: COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation elevates IL-6 levels, leading to the activation of microglia in the brain. These activated microglia release pro-inflammatory mediators, which can cause synaptic dysfunction and damage to neurons in the hippocampus, potentially affecting memory and cognitive function.

Mechanism: TNF-induced inflammation leads to neuronal death and impacts cognition.
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → Astrocyte Activation → Glial Cell Activation → Neuronal Death

Mechanism: COVID-19-induced inflammation activates astrocytes and glial cells, leading to neuronal death.
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → Microglial Activation → Neuronal Injury → TNF

Mechanism: Inflammatory responses activate microglial cells, leading to neuronal injury and TNF production.
Path:COVID-19 → TLR2 → Cytokines → Microglial Cell Activation → IL1B

Mechanism: COVID-19-driven neuroinflammation accelerates Alzheimer's disease progression by affecting APP (amyloid precursor protein) and cognition.
Path:COVID-19 → Neuroinflammation → Parkinson’s Disease → S100B → GFAP

Mechanism: COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation activates S100B and GFAP, potentially contributing to Parkinson’s disease.
Path:COVID-19 → Immunoregulation → Nitric Oxide Synthase → Neuronal Injury → CRP
Source: CBM
Mechanism: COVID-19-induced immune dysregulation elevates nitric oxide synthase levels, causing neuronal injury and increasing CRP levels.
Path:COVID-19 → Cytokine Production → Inflammation → TNF → Microglial Cell Activation
Source: SCAI-DMaps
Mechanism: Cytokine production triggers inflammation, leading to TNF expression and microglial activation.
Path:COVID-19 → Adaptive Immune Response → Cytokines → APP → Neurodegeneration
Source: SCAI-DMaps
Mechanism: The adaptive immune response to COVID-19 leads to cytokine production, impacting APP metabolism and driving neurodegeneration.
Path:COVID-19 → TLR4 → TLR4-mediated → Brain Inflammation

Mechanism: TLR4-mediated immune responses upregulated by COVID-19 contribute to brain inflammation and potential neurodegeneration.
Path:Postencephalitic Parkinson Disease → Seizure → Immunodeficiency→ immunodeficiency 74, COVID-19-related, X-linked
Source: PRIMEKG
Mechanism: COVID-19-related immunodeficiency, specifically immunodeficiency 74, X-linked, weakens the immune system, leading to neurological vulnerabilities. This can trigger seizures, which exacerbate brain inflammation and damage, potentially leading to postencephalitic Parkinson disease as a consequence of sustained neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
Path:Alzheimer Disease → SOD2 → Dilated Cardiomyopathy → Post-Viral Disorder → Sequela of COVID-19
Source: PRIMEKG
Mechanism: Alzheimer's disease progression can be influenced by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, where SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) plays a crucial role. Impaired SOD2 function exacerbates oxidative damage in both the brain and the heart, contributing to conditions like dilated cardiomyopathy. This cardiac condition may develop into a post-viral disorder, especially following viral infections. In the context of COVID-19, these post-viral effects can manifest as long-term complications, becoming a sequela of COVID-19.
