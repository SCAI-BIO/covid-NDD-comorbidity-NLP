# Exploring the Current State of Knowledge on the Link Between COVID-19 and Neurodegeneration

This repository contains the data, scripts, and analyses used in the research titled **"Understanding the Co-Morbidity between COVID-19 and Neurodegenerative Diseases at Mechanism-Level: Comprehensive Analysis Integrating Databases and Text Mining"**. The project leverages Neo4j paltform for graph-based analysis and integrates natural language processing to explore relationships between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

## Overview
This project explores the connections between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases by:
1. **Integrating database information** about COVID-19 and NDDs and storing them in a graph structure.
2. **Extracting textual data** from scientific literature and using natural language processing pipelines for information extraction and KG construction.Â 
3. **Loading all KG** in Neo4j to identify and analyse relationships and pathways between entities such as genes, diseases, and chemicals.
4. **Construction of a hypothesis database for omorbidity between COVID-19 and NDDs** to explore, analyse, and visualise testable comorbidity hypotheses.

## Data
The repository includes the following directories:

1. **Expert-curated-publications**: Contains manually curated publications relevant to the study, ensuring high-quality and accurate information.

2. **PubTator3-results**: Includes results from PubTator3, a web-based system that offers a comprehensive set of features and tools for exploring biomedical literature using advanced text mining and AI techniques. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

3. **Sherpa-results**: Houses outputs from Sherpa, a tool designed to assist in the curation of biomedical literature by providing automated annotations and insights.

4. **Textual-corpora-for-textmining**: Comprises textual corpora prepared for text mining purposes, facilitating the extraction of meaningful patterns and relationships regarding COVID-19 and NDD.

## Sources

### 1. `comorbidity-hypothesis-db.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatically opens the Neo4j Browser with prefilled credentials to connect to the AuraDB instance for comorbidity hypothesis exploration.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplifies connection to Neo4j by generating a pre-configured URL.
  - Useful for direct interaction with the knowledge graph.
- **Usage**:
  Run the script, and the Neo4j Browser will open in your default web browser:
  ```bash
  python comorbidity-hypothesis-db.py

### 2. `comorbidity-space-neo4j-upload.py`
- **Purpose**: Uplaoding the comorbidity hypothesis paths to the AuraDB instance for comorbidity hypothesis exploration. The candidate curated paths along with pmids and evidences are stored in **'src/hypothesis_pmid_evidences.csv'**. 
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplifies uploading the hypothesis comorbidity candidates.
- **Usage**:
  Run the script, and the Neo4j Browser will open in your default web browser:
  ```bash
  python comorbidity-space-neo4j-upload.py

## Notebooks

### 1. `analyze-neo4j.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the knowledge graph loaded to  Neo4j to extract insights.
- **Key Features**:
  - Counts nodes and edges in the graph.
  - Executes community detection algorithms like Louvain using Neo4j's Graph Data Science (GDS) library.
  - Retrieves and visualizes properties of detected clusters
- **Usage**:
  Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to:
  - Query the Neo4j database.
  - Get general statistics about nodes, triple and pathways, and analyze them.
 
### 2. `import-neo4j-all-dbs.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: These scripts are designed to upload multiple databases into Neo4j, providing a streamlined workflow for graph-based data integration and analysis. A key requirement for using this script is the bel_json_import package, which is specifically developed to convert BEL (Biological Expression Language) data into the eBEL (enhanced BEL) format. This conversion ensures seamless integration and analysis of complex biological networks within Neo4j and other graph-based platforms.

To successfully use this script, the data extracted from each database must be properly formatted and made accessible before initiating the upload process to Neo4j. Due to privacy concerns associated with the databases, the data is not included in this repository. 
- **Key Features**:
- Efficiently import graph data into Neo4j using a common schema.
- **Usage**:
- Open the notebook (import-neo4j-all-dbs.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Put the data in the required palces, and run each cell specific to each source to upload files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Neo4j AuraDB**: Ensure you have access to a Neo4j AuraDB instance. Use the provided connection details or set up your own.

- **Python Environment**: Install the required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install neo4j pandas

## Exploring the Covid-NDD Comorbidity Database 

To manually explore the comorbidity graph database:

1. **Open the Neo4j Browser**:

   Navigate to [https://browser.neo4j.io](https://browser.neo4j.io).

2. **Enter the Connection Details**:

   - **URI**: `neo4j+s://1af6a087.databases.neo4j.io`

   - **Username**: `neo4j`

   - **Password**: Refer to the credentials provided in the [**src/comorbidity-hypothesis-db.py**](https://github.com/SCAI-BIO/covid-NDD-comorbidity-NLP/blob/main/src/comorbidity-hypothesis-db.py).

3. **Run Cypher Queries**:

   Once connected, you can execute Cypher queries to explore the graph. For example, to retrieve a sample of nodes:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10;
