Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IFNG → IL1B → Tauopathies
Source: Sherpa
Mechanism: Inflammation increases IFN-γ and IL-18BP, leading to CXCR4 expression and immune responses.
This come from the evidence, evidence: Tau aggregates, have in turn been shown to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to further production of IL-1β by microglia and aggravation of neuroinflammation [109]. The triple extracted by Sherpa says: IL1B increases taupathies, which is not 100 percent correct but the association is stll meaningful.

Path:SARS-CoV-2 → IL6→ depression→ TNF→ neurotransmitters→ Encephalitis

Mechanism: SARS-CoV-2 triggers an inflammatory response through IL-6 and TNF, leading to neurotransmitter imbalances and depression. This neuroinflammation can escalate to encephalitis, causing acute brain inflammation.
Path:COVID-19 → Inflammation → IL10 → TREM2→ Hippocampus
Source: SCAI-DMaps
Mechanism: COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation elevates IL-6 levels, leading to the activation of microglia in the brain. These activated microglia release pro-inflammatory mediators, which can cause synaptic dysfunction and damage to neurons in the hippocampus, potentially affecting memory and cognitive function.

Path:Postencephalitic Parkinson Disease → Seizure → Immunodeficiency→ immunodeficiency 74, COVID-19-related, X-linked
Source: PRIMEKG
Mechanism: COVID-19-related immunodeficiency, specifically immunodeficiency 74, X-linked, weakens the immune system, leading to neurological vulnerabilities. This can trigger seizures, which exacerbate brain inflammation and damage, potentially leading to postencephalitic Parkinson disease as a consequence of sustained neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
Path:Alzheimer Disease → SOD2 → Dilated Cardiomyopathy → Post-Viral Disorder → Sequela of COVID-19
Source: PRIMEKG
Mechanism: Alzheimer's disease progression can be influenced by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, where SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) plays a crucial role. Impaired SOD2 function exacerbates oxidative damage in both the brain and the heart, contributing to conditions like dilated cardiomyopathy. This cardiac condition may develop into a post-viral disorder, especially following viral infections. In the context of COVID-19, these post-viral effects can manifest as long-term complications, becoming a sequela of COVID-19.
Path: COVID-19 → inflammation → IL1B 
Source: CBM
Mechanism: COVID-19 infection triggers an immune response that leads to significant inflammation, often marked by a "cytokine storm" in severe cases. This begins with the activation of immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β (Interleukin-1 beta). IL-1β amplifies the inflammatory response, promoting the production of IL-6 (Interleukin-6), a cytokine associated with systemic inflammation and neuroinflammatory processes. Elevated IL-6 levels can disrupt the blood-brain barrier and induce neuroinflammation, which impairs synaptic function and neuronal health. Prolonged neuroinflammation, combined with systemic effects, contributes to cognitive decline, as seen in many post-COVID-19 patients.

Path: Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome→Encephalomyelitis, Acute Disseminated→Headache→Epilepsy→Covid-19
Source: Sherpa
Mechanism: Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) triggers systemic and neuroinflammation, which can lead to Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a demyelinating condition marked by widespread inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. ADEM often causes severe headaches due to neural and meningeal inflammation. Persistent inflammation and neural damage may lower the seizure threshold, increasing the risk of epilepsy. In turn, epilepsy episodes, particularly in PACS, can be linked to neurological dysfunction associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, completing the feedback loop to COVID-19’s neuroinflammatory effects
