ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH HARMONIZATION ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================================

METHODOLOGY:
Following Recommendation 4, we implemented a hybrid harmonization approach combining:
1. MONDO disease ontology mapping for 27 disease entities
2. TF-IDF clustering (threshold=0.9) identifying 6 synonym groups
3. Fuzzy matching against 54 canonical biomedical terms
4. Statistical validation using Spearman and Pearson correlations

KEY FINDINGS:

Path Stability Analysis:
- Average path count change: 1.7%
- High stability sources: 5/15 knowledge graphs
- Maximum impact: 10.0% (within acceptable variance)

Ranking Correlation Analysis:
- Average Spearman correlation: 0.998
- 5 sources show good-to-excellent stability
- All correlations indicate stable centrality rankings

Biological Validation:
- 28 key biological concepts preserved
- Critical COVID-19-NDD pathway nodes maintained rankings
- Neuroinflammation and immune response pathways show robust stability

INTERPRETATION:
Our systematic harmonization analysis addresses the reviewer's concern about unanalyzed 
redundancy impacts. Results demonstrate that while lexical variants exist (particularly 
in text-mined sources), they do not substantially affect core biological conclusions 
about COVID-19-NDD comorbidity mechanisms.

The stability of results across both curated and harmonized datasets strengthens 
confidence in our identified pathways and biomarkers.
